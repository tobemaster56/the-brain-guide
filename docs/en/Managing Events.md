## **Managing Events**

![](../thebrain14-user-guide-images/image53.png)

Your brain has its own built-in Calendar. You can access it from the content area or the Timeline View to add and modify events and integrate them with your thoughts. You can view your Calendar a day, week, month, or year at a time.

TheBrain also has several different ways to assist you with managing your time, so you’ll know when events are taking place, when content was edited and when projects are due.

**Creating an Event**

You can create a new event from the content area or from the Timeline. Both methods give you full access to all event settings. Events support spellcheck and markdown formatting in their descriptions.

**Creating an Event from the Content Area**

1. Select the thought with which the new event will be associated.

2. Click the **Attachment** button in the content area toolbar, then click **Create** **Event**.

Events created from the content area are automatically associated with the active thought, but you can easily detach them.

**Figure 287. Creating a New Event in the Content Area**


Use the event editor pop-up to enter details about the event. By default, the name of the event is the name of the active thought.

As shown below, you can specify start and stop times and dates and add a label, description, and location in the event editor pop-up. You can make the event recurring and set up a reminder. You can also color code an event—so that all events of a specific type (personal, marketing, finance, etc.) will appear in your Timeline view in an identifiable color. Event will inherit from colors from

associated thoughts.

**Creating an Event from the Timeline**

1. Unless it is already open, display the Timeline by clicking the **Timeline** command in the **View** menu or the **Timeline** button to the left of the Search box.

2. Drag on the time ruler at the bottom to select the start and stop times of the event. After you finish dragging, the event editor will be displayed. By default, this will be a standalone event, not associated with the current active thought. You can easily attach it to the active thought by clicking **Attach to** “*active thought*” in the event editor menu.

information about using the Timeline and 1-click fine-tuning based on your preferences.

**Responding to Event Reminders**

Reminders appear when the brain containing the event is open.

**Figure 291. TheBrain’s Event Reminder Pop-Up**

From the **Reminder** window, you can snooze for a designated amount of time or

dismiss the reminder. Dismissing the reminder does not delete the event in your

timeline.

**Editing and Deleting Events**

**To edit or delete an event from the Content Area:**

- In the content area for the Thought associated with the event, right-click the

event you want to work with, then choose a command from the context menu.

Choose **Properties** to edit the details of the event.

Events associated with **Forgotten Thoughts** will only appear in the timeline if

Forgotten Thoughts are being viewed in the plex. Like the faded display in the plex, the thought’s event will also appear as faded text.
