**Synchronizing Your Brain**

With TheBrain and TheBrain Cloud Services you can use your brain on multiple computers and synchronize changes. Any changes you make to your brain on one machine will be reflected on every other machine through synchronization!

Cloud synchronization is protected using 128-bit AES Encryption. (This is the same encryption used by the US government to protect classified information.)

![](../thebrain14-user-guide-images/image19.png)

Port 443 is used for encrypted syncs. If your IT staff is using a firewall, you can ask them to add WebBrain.com and api.thebrain.com to the white list of your company's firewall. If your IT staff is using a proxy, you will need to try setting up a Proxy connection via TheBrain by using the options found in TheBrain’s Preferences > System tab.

![](../thebrain14-user-guide-images/image19.png)

Make sure you have created an account on TheBrain.com before you begin synchronizing. Some Cloud services require a subscription fee.

**To synchronize your brain:**

1. Open the brain you wish to sync. Click the cloud icon in the menu bar, or click the **Online** menu, then click the **Sync Brain** command.

**Figure 303. Sync Brain Command**

2. Click the **Upload** button to upload this local brain.

![](../thebrain14-user-guide-images/image364.png)

**Figure 304. Confirming Upload**

3. A progress indicator shows you the upload is taking place, followed by a brief confirmation message.

You can keep working while the synchronization process is continuing in the

![](../thebrain14-user-guide-images/image19.png)

background. If there is an interruption during an initial upload of your brain, TheBrain will offer to resume from where it was stopped the next time you synchronize.

3. When the process is complete, just go to the other computer on which you want to access your brain. Open TheBrain application and log in. From the list of available brains, click on TheBrain thumbnail, then click the

**Download** button when it appears.

![](../thebrain14-user-guide-images/image365.png)

**Figure 305. Download for Local Use**

4. To synchronize at any time, click the cloud icon in the menu bar or the **Sync Brain** command in the **Online** menu. The active copy of your brain will include the latest changes.


Once your brain has been synced, your brain will be automatically set to auto-

sync. To turn this feature off, click the **Sync Status** button next to the Cloud icon

in the tool bar.

![](../thebrain14-user-guide-images/image366.png)

**Figure 306. The Sync Status Button**

The Sync Status will also display if local changes or online changes are available

or if the sync is up to date. The last sync date will also be displayed.

Brain thumbnails in your list of available brains will indicate if a brain is local only,

local and online (synced) or online only.

**Editing Your Online Brain**

The desktop application has more available features than the web client, but you

can still access and edit your online brains by performing any of the following

activities:

- Create and Forget Thoughts

- Change thought locations (child to jump)

- Unlink thoughts

- Set Pins


- Edit Notes

- Add Attachments

![](../thebrain14-user-guide-images/image19.png)

You can only edit brains that YOU own.

**To edit notes in your online brain:**

- Click in the content area and make any changes you like. The revised note

will be saved automatically as soon as you click on another thought.

**Sharing Your Online Brain**

All brains synced to are private and not accessible to

other users without entials. To share a Version 12 brain

with other users:

- Open the brain in your local desktop application

- Click the **Online** menu, then click **Brain Access and Sharing…**

- You have two different options for sharing your brain:

o**Option 1:** Click the **Allow Public Access** check box and **share the Web**

**Link** with others. This is a great option for sharing your brain with a large

group of other users or other users that do not use TheBrain software.

Anyone with the URL will be able to view your brain in read-only mode in

their web browser.

o**Option 2:** Leave **Allow Public Access** unchecked and type in an email

address to **invite individual users** to access your brain. This is a good

option if you want other users to be able to download a local, read-only

copy of this brain to their desktop app. The other users must have

TheBrain installed and be logged in to their Brain account with the email

address you specified.

**To prepare your brain to be shared:**

1. Activate the thought that you want to be the Home thought when your brain

is viewed. It will be the first thought your viewers see.

-Right-click the thought, then click the **Set as Home Thought**

command

![](../thebrain14-user-guide-images/image19.png)

The current wallpaper and color theme will be included in your published brain.

**Creating a Brain Archive to Send Your Brain to Others**

You can send your brain as an email attachment. To make the attachment as small as possible, you can use TheBrain’s **Backup to Brain Archive** feature to create a compact file.

**To create a Brain Archive:**

1. Click the **File** menu, then click the **Backup to Brain Archive** command.

2. In the **Backup to Brain Archive** dialog box, select either of the Access Control options.


![](../thebrain14-user-guide-images/image369.png)

**Figure 309. Create Brain Archive Options**

3. If necessary, click the **Change** button to change the file name or the folder where the archive file will be saved. Do not change the filename extension, which is .BRZ. Click the **Backup** button to create the archive file.

![](../thebrain14-user-guide-images/image19.png)

Make a note of where you are saving your archive file so that you can locate it easily when needed.

A brief message will display in the toolbar area as the archive is created.

![](../thebrain14-user-guide-images/image19.png)

Brain Archive files are NOT .zip files. You should not use zip file utilities to modify or access your archive files as doing so may corrupt them.

**Copying Thoughts into Other Applications as an Outline**

You can copy thoughts from the Selection panel into other programs such as Microsoft Word or Excel and the thoughts will be formatted as an indented hierarchical list.

**To copy one or more thoughts into another program as an outline:**

1. Select all of the thoughts you want to include in the outline (**Ctrl**-click on a thought to add it to the selection or use the commands on the **Edit** menu to quickly create a selection).

2. Right click in the Selection panel and then click the **Copy as Text Outline** command.


![](../thebrain14-user-guide-images/image370.png)

**Figure 310. Copying Thoughts as an Outline**

3. Open the other application and click where the outline version of the thoughts should be inserted.

4. Right-click and then click the **Paste** command on the context menu (or click the **Edit** menu and then click the **Paste** command).

![](../thebrain14-user-guide-images/image371.png)

**Figure 311. Samples of Outlines Created by Pasting Thoughts from TheBrain**

**Copying Outlines with Notes**

You can copy selected thoughts along with their notes and place them in a tabbed outline.

1. Select the thoughts to be copied, then right-click in the Selection panel to open the context menu.


2. Click the **Copy as Text Outline with Notes** command.

3. Switch to Word or any other text application of your choice and press **Ctrl**-V (or use the program’s command for pasting).

**Pasting a Text Outline as New Thoughts**

You can select tab-delineated text in another application, copy it, then paste it into your brain. Each paragraph of text will become a child thought (and possibly an attachment) of the active thought, based on the formatting of the text.

Pasted outlines may include labels, attachments, and notes. If a URL is included, it is added as an attachment to the thought in the outline entry above the entry containing the URL.

**How TheBrain converts content from the source file:**

- Each line that ends with an “Enter” or “Shift-Enter” becomes a thought

- A multi-line paragraph with no manual line breaks becomes a thought

- Indentation created using tabs show hierarchical relationships

- Lines starting with a hyphen (-) are added as notes

- Lines starting with a plus sign (+) are added as web link attachments

- If a pipe (|) symbol is inserted, content to the left of the pipe will be the thought name and content to the right of the pipe will become a label (if all content is in the same paragraph)

**Example:**

The following text adds a thought named “Steve Jobs” with the label “Founder of Apple,” a link to Wikipedia, and a note containing a quotation.

Steve Jobs | Founder of Apple

+ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs -"I want to put a ding in the universe."
