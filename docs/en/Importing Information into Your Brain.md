**Figure 313. Importing Folders and Mind Maps**

You can import folders and Mind Maps into your brain. When you import a folder, it becomes a child thought of the active thought.

**To Begin Importing:**

1. Activate the thought that will receive the imported information.


2. Click the **File** menu, then click the **Import** command.

**For a Folder:**

- Click**Folders**, select the **Add to** … button, click the **Select Folder** button, navigate to the folder of your choice, then click the **OK** button. Click the **Import** button as soon as it becomes available. Click the next **Import** button to confirm that you understand this import can’t be undone. Each folder will become a thought, every file inside the folder will become and attachment, and any subfolders will become child thoughts.

**For a Mind Map:**

- Click**MindManager (.mmap)**, select the **Add to** … button, click the **Select** **File** button, navigate to the file of your choice, then click the **Open** button. Each of the topics or ideas will become a separate child thought of the active

thought.

**Importing TheBrain 8 XMLs**

Version 8 brains that have been exported into an XML format (or properly-formatted XML that has been generated outside of TheBrain) can easily be

imported back into another brain as a child of the active thought.

1. Activate the thought that will receive the imported XML.

2. Click the **File** menu, click the **Import** command, then select the **Add to** …

button.

3. Click **TheBrain 8 XML**, click the **Select File** button, navigate to the file of your choice, then click the **Open** button.

**Merging Brains**

You can merge two brains together by importing a Brain Archive file (.BRZ):

1. Open the brain that you want to merge into another brain, click the **File** menu, then click the **Backup to Brain Archive** command.

2. Note the location for the new .BRZ file, then click **Backup**.

3. Open the brain that will receive the merged brain, navigate to the thought where you want the .BRZ file to be added as a child, click the **File** menu, then click the **Import** command.

4. Select the **Add to “*open brain name”* and link to “*active thought name”*** option, then click **Brain Archive (brz)** in the list.

5. Click the **Select File** button, then navigate to and open the initial .BRZ file you created in the first step. Click the **Import** button. You will be prompted

to confirm that you want to continue, since importing a .BRZ file can’t be undone.

The only brain that is changed is the one that is open when you begin the merge procedure. The brain you select during step 1 is not changed at all.
