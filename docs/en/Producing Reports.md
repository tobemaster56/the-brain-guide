![](../thebrain14-user-guide-images/image53.png)

Reports are an excellent way to manage large groups of thoughts in your Brain.

To open a brain's Report area, click the **View** menu then click the **Report** command. You may also click on the **Right Panel** button next to the search box. The report pane is resizable.

**Selecting Report Criteria**

The **Thoughts** drop-down list includes the following options and each selection provides additional criteria choices for fine-tuning your reports.

![](../thebrain14-user-guide-images/image326.png)

**Figure 267. Thought Options for Reports** You can run reports based on the criteria discussed below.


**By Types/Tags**

The **By Types/Tags** option in the **Thoughts** drop-down helps you filter thoughts in your Report by checking for specific thought Types and Tags for thoughts and/or for links. All thoughts or links that don’t meet the criteria will be excluded from the report. By default, thoughts of any Type will be included.

- Click the field to the right of **Types** (which will display “Any” if no Types have been selected yet), then select the check box for each thought Type to be included. Click outside of the list to close it.

**Figure 268. Selecting Thoughts by Types**

Use the **Tags** field to filter thoughts based on your assigned Tags.

![](../thebrain14-user-guide-images/image328.png)

**Figure 269. Filtering a Report by Tags**

Clicking on a Tag in the list will add a “**+**” next to it, indicating that you want to list thoughts that have that Tag. Clicking the same Tag again will add a “**-**“ next to it.

This indicates that you do not want thoughts with that Tag listed. Clicking the same Tag once more will remove it from your list of filtered Tags.

**Figure 270. Filtering With and Without Tags**

Use Types and Tags together in a report for some incredibly powerful thought filtering. When your report is displayed, you can click on any result to

immediately navigate to the thought.

**Forgotten Thoughts**

The Forgotten thoughts selection allows you to quickly view and access any thoughts you have forgotten in a brain.

![](../thebrain14-user-guide-images/image330.png)

**Figure 271. Forgotten Thoughts Report**


With **Forgotten** selected in the **Thoughts** drop-down, you can use the menu button to add all forgotten thoughts in your report to your Selection, remove all forgotten thoughts in your report from your Selection, permanently delete all forgotten thoughts in your report, or remember all forgotten thoughts in your report.

![](../thebrain14-user-guide-images/image331.png)

**Figure 272. Choices for Forgotten Thoughts**

As soon as you click any forgotten thought in the list, a “Showing Forgotten thoughts” message will display above the plex. Click any forgotten thought in the report to display that thought in the plex.

**Figure 274. Parentless Thought Report**

Viewing a Parentless Thought Report is great for tying up any loose connections or finding groups of disconnected "satellite thought clusters" in your brain for easy reconnection and clean-up.

Orphan thoughts will also appear in a Parentless Thought Report. Jump

![](../thebrain14-user-guide-images/image19.png)

thoughts (when they have no Parent) will frequently appear in this report as well.

**Orphan Thoughts**

Select **Orphan** in the **Thoughts** drop-down to quickly view and access any thoughts that do not have any other connections.

![](../thebrain14-user-guide-images/image334.png)

**Figure 275. Orphan Thought Report**

Viewing an Orphan Thought Report is an excellent way to find lost thoughts or thoughts that may have inadvertently been disconnected at some point. Is there a thought you know you had in your brain? Try running an Orphan Thought Report to see if it was previously unlinked by accident.


**Duplicate Names**

Select **Duplicate Names** in the **Thoughts** drop-down to quickly view and access multiple thoughts with the same name.

![](../thebrain14-user-guide-images/image335.png)

**Figure 276. Duplicate Names Report**

Viewing the Duplicate Thoughts Report can help you organize and manage your brain to make sure you are getting the most out of your information with quick access to the most important thoughts.

**By Attachments**

Select **By Attachments** in the **Thoughts** drop-down to quickly view and access all thoughts that have an attachment. By default, only internal attachments will be included and you can use the Type drop-down list to fine-tune as needed.

the **Time** drop-down selections. This is incredibly useful for finding information

modified within a specific date range and allows for even more in-depth reporting.
