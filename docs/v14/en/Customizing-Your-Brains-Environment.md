## **Customizing Your Brain’s Environment**

You may choose to use your brain just as it’s offered “out of the box” or you may choose to change some of the environmental settings to suit your personal preferences.

**TheBrain’s Default Settings**

Without making any changes, here’s what your brain looks like:

- The area where your thoughts appear (the plex) will be the color and design of one of TheBrain’s “Themes.” The initial theme is randomly selected and you can change it at any time.

- The left half of TheBrain window will display your thoughts and the right half of the window will display the “Content Area” which holds notes and any other items you will attach to your thoughts—files, web pages, Events, etc.

- Your thoughts will be displayed in “Normal” view, meaning that you will see only the direct parents, children, jumps, and siblings of the active thought.

**Figure 45. TheBrain Window with Default Settings**

**Using Smart-Splitter to Arrange TheBrain Window**

The smart-splitter controls let you manage where the plex and content area display relative to each other in the Brain window.


![](/thebrain14-user-guide-images/image59.png)

**Figure 46. Smart-Splitter**

- Click the individual left- and right-arrows (or up- and down-arrows if the window is in “over-and-under” mode) to maximize the area the arrow is pointing towards (either the plex or the content area).

- Click the double-headed arrow icon to toggle the plex to the right or left side of the content area.

- Click on the two-arrow icon that forms a box to toggle between seeing the plex and content area "side-by-side" or “over-and-under.”

- You can also point at the border between areas and click and drag when the double-headed arrow appears to move the border.

**Moving Thoughts in the Plex**

When the default settings are in use and the plex is in “Normal” view, you can move the thoughts in the plex up or down, vertically, by dragging (up or down) in any blank area of the plex background.

**Figure 47. Dragging the Plex Vertically**

**Resizing Thoughts in the Plex**

The plex is the heart and soul of TheBrain. You can change the size of thoughts in the plex by using TheBrain toolbar or your keyboard and mouse.

**To change the size of thoughts using the toolbar:**

- Click the **AA** button to activate the slider, then click and slide the bar up or down to grow or shrink the size of your thoughts.


![](/thebrain14-user-guide-images/image61.png)

**Customizing a Brain’s Appearance**

**Selecting a Theme**

The Themes feature lets you choose from many built-in designs to customize the look of your brain, including the appearance of the plex and notes in the content area. You can change many of the default colors and the style of notes

associated with the Theme, then save the look of your brain as a new Theme. This lets you quickly switch from one saved Theme to another.
