## **Find and Replace**

Find and replace all occurrences of text within thought names and labels, link labels, external attachment paths and URLs.

- Includes support for regular expressions.

- Can be applied to the entire brain or to a group of selected thoughts.

- Changes are undoable however it is still highly recommended that you create a brain Archive (.brz) prior to performing a large Find and Replace operation on an important brain.

**To begin replacing:**

1. Open the **File** menu, select **Utilities**, then select **FindandReplace**. 
2. Enter the text to be replaced and the text to replace it with.
3. Specify where the text occurs. The available locations are: - Thought Names

- Thought Labels

- Link Labels

- External Attachment Paths

- Attached URLs


4. Use the check boxes to specify whether letter case is to be ignored and if

you want to use regex (regular expressions, which allow sophisticated

pattern matching capabilities).

5. Preview your results prior to executing the change and click **Replace** when

you’re ready.
