## **Understanding Thought Relationships**

There are no rules governing the relationships between thoughts—whatever makes sense to *you* is the way your brain ought to be organized. The three primary relationship types―child, parent, and jump―can be used to express different types of relationships. Sibling is a relationship that is derived from child/parent relationships.

The examples in this section can help you understand the variety of relationships and how they are used. The core concepts behind each type of relationship are as follows:

- **Children**: Child thoughts are usually used to link more specific information or information that represents a sub-category.

- **Parents:** Thoughts linked as Parents are usually used to link more general information. Parents can also be thought of as higher-level categories to classify groups of information. They serve to indirectly connect their child thoughts as siblings.

- **Jumps:** Jump thoughts are usually used to link two pieces of information that are exclusively related, meaning that the two items are related to each other but neither represents a group that the other is a part of.

Let’s move on to an example to explore these relationship types. Imagine that you are the owner of a company and you are reviewing personnel files. Each employee has a file. You decide it makes sense to organize your employees by department. Your brain is called My Brain. From My Brain, you create a child thought called My Company (see Figure 15). My Brain is now My Company’s parent thought. You create four child thoughts from My Company—

Manufacturing, Sales, Service, and Billing. These departments are sibling thoughts of each other.

**Figure 15. Sample Brain**

Now you go to each department and create more child thoughts, one for each employee of the department. If an employee splits time between two

departments, you can make him a child thought of both departments—he’ll appear in both and you won’t have to duplicate his thought. In this example, Bob is a child thought of both Manufacturing and Sales (see Figure 16). This is one of the most powerful features of TheBrain—having one thought under more than one heading.

**Figure 16. Child Thought with Two Parents**

If you own more than one company, but have one accountant for all of them, you might want to create a thought called Accountant and link it as a jump thought to each company, as shown below.

**Figure 17. Jump Thoughts to the Active Thought**

Imagine that Joe’s company has just purchased one of your companies. Since Joe’s company now owns this company, Joe’s Company becomes a parent (see

below).

**Figure 18. New Parent Thought**

Because Joe wants to avoid a conflict of interest, the acquired company (My Other Company) no longer uses the same accountant. So its jump gate is hollow, while its sibling’s jump gate (My Company) maintains that link and is filled.

As you use TheBrain, you will develop a sense of the types of relationships you wish to make between thoughts. It is always easy to change relationships by adding and removing links (see Changing Relationships Using Drag and Drop on

page 108).


**Families of Thoughts**

It is tempting to view thought relationships as families, and indeed these different parts of your brain are types of families, with their ancestry visually spread before you, represented by subjects and categories. But unlike human families, a child thought can be a parent of one of its siblings and a thought can have more than two parents.

The complex relationships you can form in TheBrain are the source of its power. Let’s consider sibling thoughts that also share a parent/child relationship.

Let’s say you are studying philosophy. You might have a thought called

Philosophy. Individual philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle could be child thoughts of Philosophy. Each of these siblings, in turn, may have child thoughts.

Aristotle was a student of Plato, so you may want to make Aristotle not only a

child of Philosophy, but of Plato, so that when you’re working with Aristotle, Plato

is only a thought away.

**Figure 19. Example of Parent/Child Relationships**

Notice that when Philosophy and Plato are in Aristotle’s parent *zone*, their relationship (Philosophy is a parent thought of Plato) is shown by the line linking the child gate of Philosophy to the parent gate of Plato.

Clearly, TheBrain is a powerful method of organizing ideas and information. No hierarchical file structure can provide as much cross-referenced information at a glance. And our example is pretty basic—a fully developed brain can hold many more relationships and much more information.
