## **Using Mobile Versions of TheBrain**

Access your ideas and information on all your devices—including iOS and Android. TheBrain for mobile devices combines the best of note-taking, file synchronization, and mind mapping apps to give you the ultimate digital memory everywhere you go.

The iOS and Android apps include the ability to sync your brain so you can access it without an Internet connection. Once you download your brain locally to your mobile device, just click the **Sync** button after making edits or if edits have been made to TheBrain Cloud.
