## **Exporting**

TheBrain features several export options. Export your brain data directly to:

- **Folders**—Exports the thoughts in your brain by converting them to a folder hierarchy.

o Each thought becomes a folder containing the attachments and notes within it.

o The folder structure attempts to mimic the parent-child relationships between thoughts with parentless thoughts at the top level.

o Shortcuts on Windows and symbolic links on macOS are used to represent thoughts that are under multiple parents.

- **Text Outline** (.txt file)—Creates a text outline of thoughts, notes and URLs.

o Indented hierarchy mimics parent-child relationships between thoughts.

o Notes are exported as lines starting with a - (dash)

o URLS are added lines starting with a + (plus)

- **JSON Files**—Exports your brain data in JSON format.

o Thoughts, links and other types of data are each exported in their own .json file.


o Attachments and notes are exported into folders based on the ID of the thought or link they are attached to.

o This gives you access to 100% of your data in an open and easily parsed modern text format.

**To export your brain:**

- Select **Export** from the **File** menu

- Select the output (Folders, Text or JSON) and click on **Export**

- The output location must be an empty directory

- To export just a portion of your brain, add thoughts first into TheBrain’s Selection panel and then check the option to **Only export the selection** in the **Export** window.
